<p>What happens when you want a scoreboard to have the numbers animate in OBS? Maybe buy something that does it for you.</p>
</p>Just kidding.<b> I built something that does it for free. </b>All you need is a file.</p>

<p>It's simple - give the index.html file a path for a .txt file, and it will take the numbers in it and add a counting animation - it also updates every second, so live counters like subsrciber/follower counts would work well.</p>
