<p>What happens when you want a scoreboard to have the numbers animate in OBS? Maybe buy something that does it for you.</p>
</p>Just kidding.<b> I built something that does it for free. </b>All you need is to give it a .txt file (or files.)</p>

<p>It's simple - just edit the config.json file to give it a path (or multiple paths) to watch, and it will take the numbers in it and add a counting animation for each file - it also updates every second! Great for your live follower/subscriber counts, among other things.</p>

<b>Installation:</b>

<ol>
  <li>You'll need a local web server installed - I personally recommend <a href="https://laragon.org/download/index.html">Laragon</a> or <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">XAMPP</a> personally, as they are both easy to use.</li>
  <li>Once you have a local server installed properly, move the CounterAnimate folder's contents into the correct location (for example, in Laragon, the correct directory would be laragon/www).</li>
  <li>Edit the config.json file to show CounterAnimate where to look for your number to animate - there is an example in the config file by default to show you how to set it up. OPTIONAL: You can also edit the counteranimate.css file if you want to add a background colour to the browser window, or change the colour of the text.</li>
  <li>Ensure your local web server is up and running, you should be able to open the test URL (in Laragon, that would be counteranimate.test by default). Assuming CounterAnimate was configured properly, you should have updating numbers with their titles above (like shown below.)</li>
</ol>
